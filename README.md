# A-Recommender-system-for-vacation-Rentals-Using-Natural-Language-Processing-and-Deep-Learning
The project is carried out to build a Recommender system for Vacation Rentals in Canada. We use Natural Language processing and Deep Learning  Algorithms to model Vacation Reviews and ratings and reviews for building the Recommender system. Data was obtained by scraping the website www.tripadvisor.ca with the keyword 'Vacation Rentals' .
